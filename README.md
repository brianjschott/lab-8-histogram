# lab-8-histogram

## Purpose

This lab is designed to teach you how to use an array, and how to count values in an array

## Objective

Take an array of integers where each value is from 0-9. Output how many occurrences of each number exist.

## Sample Output
#### If my array was 1 3 3 2 3 5 5 5 5 4 5 5 4 5, the output would be...

0 - 0
1 - 1
2 - 1
3 - 3
4 - 2
5 - 7
6 - 0
7 - 0
8 - 0
9 - 0


## Extra Credit
For 15 extra points, use Scanner to input the array to be counted as a String. Then, use the .split method to generate the array to be counted.
